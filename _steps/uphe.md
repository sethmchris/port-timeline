One of many responses to UIPAâ€™s plan, Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment call into question the lack of analysis of the effects the port will have on air quality, leaving them to assume that the port will increase air pollution and the negative side effects that come with it. They also scrutinize the associated public health costs that will be borne onto the local community, as well as the potential negative effects of pesticides that could be used to control the native mosquito population.
