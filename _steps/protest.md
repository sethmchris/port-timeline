Eight people are arrested on various charges after storming the Chamber of Commerce Building. Protesters at the scene vow to continue crashing UIPA board meetings until the port is cancelled, citing negative impacts on air quality, climate change, surrounding habitats, and Salt Lake City’s west-side residents. Governor Herbert says the violence that erupted at the protest is “borderline terrorism”.
